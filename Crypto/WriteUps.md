## Answer:

+ When you solve the equation you get the answer as 64. 
+ [Tutorial](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Solutions/Alg/SolveExpEqns/Prob7.aspx)
+ b = 4, c = 6
+ From this, you need to infer that the encryption used is Base 64
+ You need to apply the Base 64 encryption to the input string which is hex
+ Something to note:
   + If you try to directly paste the input string in a converter online, it’ll probably recognise it as an ASCII string. This is misdirection, if you try to apply base 64 to the ascii string, it’ll give you a human readable string that’s not the correct flag. 
   + You can avoid this by writing your own code for it, which usually does the trick.
   + Also a note to be made, flags always need not be human readable. People tend to think they are, but that isn't necessary.

   + Here's the actual flag:

The flag is the concatenation of the first and last word of this text. The flag is of the format CTF{Concatenated_string}

## Answer: 

   + What you need to do in this question is something known as “frequency analysis”. 
   + You can look it up on google, essentially you try to guess what the most common letters are based on generalised statistics.
   + A good keyword to start with is look at all 3 letter words in the ciphertext and then try to guess which one of those is “the”
   + The flag is CTF{maryamjodie)

The 3rd letter of each of the first 6 languages concatenated together makes the flag. The flag is of the format ctf{ Concatenated_string }


## Answer: 

   + You need to find out the different languages used in the input given.
   + Some languages have similar dialects, so you might not get the correct answer in one go. Trial and error
   + Japanese, Albanian, Greek, Portugese, Odia, English, Spanish (7th language so doesn't even matter)
   + Not a lot of logic here, just search and replce.

# 777

+ Remove all the 777's from the cipher text.
+ Convert integer to ascii.
+ To get the flag.

# The National Treasure

## Description

Let's have a little recap of one of the cult classics.
Here we have an Ottendorf Cipher and we will use the same Benjamin Franklin's Silence Dogood letters (https://www.kalh.org/silence.pdf).
Can you decrypt it just like the movies?

+ A video was given as a reference for understanding the Ottendorf Cipher.
+ According to the video, the first number indicated letter/page number, second indicated the line number and third indicated the position of the letter on that line.
+ Hence all we had to do was manually decipher each line in the cipher.txt file.

# Lots!!!

+ Method 1 [Before Hints]
	+ Question Description mentions "First Caesar and his many ciphers"
	+ Not too straighforward but ...
		+ First Caesar - JULIUS [Most commonly used first name of caesar]
		+ Many ciphers - Vigenere cipher is a combination of multipl caesar ciphers.
	+ Solve a vigenere cipher with JULIUS as the key.
	+ Entire cipher text as in caps so mostlikely that Key was also in caps.

+ Method 2 [After Hints]
	+ "What has more caesar ciphers than caesar ciphers itself" - [Could have directly said it was a vigenere cipher]
	+ "First of caesar not just caesar is a key to your problem" - JULIUS is the key
	+ Decrypt Vigenere Cipher to get the answer with key JULIUS.

# Bobby and Alice

## Description

Bobby to avenge the loss from the previous CTF approaches Alice who is a RSA expert.
She comes up with a cipher m and gives it to Bobby.
Can you decrypt that message ?

Learn about RSA here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

+ We know that the Cipher given was RSA based on the description.
+ Here the value of 'm' was actually the cipher 'c' which was mentioned in wikipedia.
+ We can see that Alice had given the private key as well (the mistake!!).
+ All we needed to do was use the formula mentioned in the wikipedia
+ The message is also in long int. Hence we use long_to_bytes() from Crypto.Util.number.
+ The python code used to decode
