# Cryptography Challenges

# 777

+ Remove all the 777's from the cipher text.
+ Convert integer to ascii.
+ To get the flag.

# Lots!!!

+ Method 1 [Before Hints]
	+ Question Description mentions "First Caesar and his many ciphers"
	+ Not too straighforward but ...
		+ First Caesar - JULIUS [Most commonly used first name of caesar]
		+ Many ciphers - Vigenere cipher is a combination of multipl caesar ciphers.
	+ Solve a vigenere cipher with JULIUS as the key.
	+ Entire cipher text as in caps so mostlikely that Key was also in caps.

+ Method 2 [After Hints]
	+ "What has more caesar ciphers than caesar ciphers itself" - [Could have directly said it was a vigenere cipher]
	+ "First of caesar not just caesar is a key to your problem" - JULIUS is the key
	+ Decrypt Vigenere Cipher to get the answer with key JULIUS.
