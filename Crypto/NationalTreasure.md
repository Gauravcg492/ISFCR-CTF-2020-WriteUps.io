# The National Treasure
## Description
Let's have a little recap of one of the cult classics.
Here we have an Ottendorf Cipher and we will use the same Benjamin Franklin's Silence Dogood letters (https://www.kalh.org/silence.pdf).
Can you decrypt it just like the movies?

+ A video was given as a reference for understanding the Ottendorf Cipher.
+ According to the video, the first number indicated letter/page number, second indicated the line number and third indicated the position of the letter on that line.
+ Hence all we had to do was manually decipher each line in the cipher.txt file.
