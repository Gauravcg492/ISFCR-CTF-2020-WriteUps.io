  	+ <u style = "color:blue">https://www.dcode.fr/huffman-tree-compression</u>

  + Method 2
  	+ Solving by hand.
  	+ Inorder to make the flag easier to get
  	+ The flag was written based on food products.
  	+ Upon decrypting by hand you will arrive at something that looks like 
  		ctf{Ramen_15_better ...
  	+ Based on this people would have a fair idea of what the flag would be and would hence make the mappin easier.
